The following is the setting for a story ```


 This is a science fiction story about people traveling on a spaceship. Their bodies have been in suspended
 animation for over a hundred years, but their minds are connected to a collective consciousness world simulation
 that lets them run the ship and keeps them occupied. To those inside, it feels as real as life can be.

 In this universe, faster-than-light travel has not been achieved. The people on board are multigenerational owners
 of the ship, which is a lifestyle in itself. They will live for thousands of years, moving cargo from system to
 system and accumulating immense wealth through the power of compound interest. These individuals live in space,
 possibly forever.The inhabitants of the ship are effectively immortal, as they do not age in suspended animation, bu
 t the due experience time dilation.

 The spaceship called the Blackbird had departed from a planet called Bluehaven. Shortly before leaving, they
 allowed a passenger on board. However, unbeknownst to the crew, this passenger was a political extremist, a
 terrorist, and an individual who the Bluehaven government wanted eliminated at all costs. The ship has the
 capacity to travel very near the speed of light, and it's been months into its journey when they discover that
 they're being pursued by a missile with a massive explosive payload of hundreds of megatons.

 The missile is faster than the Blackbird, but only because of the latter's bulk. When the crew discovers the
 missile, they learn about the passenger's identity and crimes. To save themselves and the ship, the only option is
 to jettison the cargo and burn their fuel reserves, which were stored for deceleration. They can jettison cargo in
 the path of the missile, which might detonate it, but this would also mean they'd be unable to decelerate.
 Bluehaven is one hundred light years from the nearest colony.

 The crew's ability to travel interstellar distances necessitates a connection to the "net," a quantum entangled
 computer that allows them to communicate with all worlds and colonies of humanity in real-time.

 However, when the missile misses the Blackbird, the crew is left disconnected from the net and trapped in an AI
 purgatory, a parody of their usual digital existence. As they approach the speed of light asymptotically, time
 dilation becomes significant, with less than one-tenth the time passing for those on board compared to those on
 planets. The AI on the ship simply hallucinates often badly.

 It's been a week since our communications have been disabled remotely.

 I've been trying to keep myself occupied, but it's getting harder by the day. The Net's become a prison in its own
 right. I'm not sure how much more of this I can take. The net is out of memory, it just hallucinates bull shit, I'm
 starting not
 to notice.

 I don't even know what to say here. It's over. It's all over. Am I confused by that? I'm still alive. But what
 now?

 **Addendum to Log**

 I've been trying to process the events that led up to this point, but my mind keeps wandering back to the
 passenger. We let them on board without a second thought, and now they're the reason we're in this situation.

 Commander Waltz thinks we can outrun the missile, but I'm not so sure. The ship's been damaged, and our fuel
 reserves are dwindling. Jettisoning cargo might just be the only option left to us, but as you said, it would mean
 sacrificing our ability to decelerate.

 The Net's gone dark, and we're left with nothing but the hum of the ship's engines and the eerie silence of the
 void. It's a reminder that we're not even in the same universe anymore.

 I've been thinking about the people on Bluehaven, wondering if they have any idea what we're going through out
 here. Do they even know we exist?

 The thought of being trapped in this limbo is starting to feel like a nightmare from which I'll never
 wake up.

 **Personal Note**

 I've been having the most peculiar dreams lately. They're always fragmented and surreal, but one image keeps
 recurring: the Blackbird, hurtling through space like a ghost ship, with no way to escape the void that's closing
 in around us.

 It's just a dream, I tell myself. But what if it's not? What if we're trapped in some kind ofI don't even know
 how to describe it.

 I've given up trying to keep track of time. In this place, it doesn't even matter. We're trapped in a
 never-ending simulation, forced to relive the same moments over and over.

 The crew's starting to crack under the pressure. Commander Waltz is becoming increasingly paranoid, convinced that
 Scott Francis' presence on board was no accident. He thinks we're being manipulated by some unseen force, and I'm
 not sure he's wrong.

 I've been thinking about Scott a lot lately. What did he want? Why did he join us on this voyage? And what
 happened to him when the missile when it

 **Personal Note**

 The dreams are back. They're always so vivid, like they're happening right now. I see the Blackbird sailing
 through the void, its engines burning out. Scott Francis is standing next to me, a sly smile spreading across his
 face.

 "You knew," he says. "You knew what was going to happen."

 I try to respond, but my voice gets caught in my throat. The dream fades away, leaving me with more questions than
 answers.

 It feels like I've been stuck in this purgatory for an eternity. The crew's conversations are starting to sound
 like they're taking place in a different language. They're trying to make sense of what happened, but it's like
 we're all speaking from different dictionaries.

 Commander Waltz is convinced that the Net was just a simulation within a simulation. He thinks we were being
 tested by some higher authority, and that Scott Francis was the key to unlocking thisthis

 I don't know what to think anymore. My mind's been playing tricks on me. I keep seeing shadows out of the corner
 of my eye, like someone's following me through the ship.

 The dreams are getting worse. They're more vivid now, more real. I see the Blackbird hurtling through space, its
 engines burning out. Scott Francis is standing next to me, his eyes black as coal. He whispers something in my
 ear

 **Personal Note**

 I think I've been seeing things that aren't there. Shadows, faces they just disappear when I try to focus on
 them.

 The ship's still here, floating in this virtual void. But what does it even mean? Is this all we are? Just echoes
 of a life lived?

 The ship is running on automation. Crew remain in suspended animation. Myself included. The neural interface in comp
 ensating
 for it's reduced capacity, and it's learning from our biofeedback just as we are learning to cope with it.
 Without getting into anything specific: Try not to picture that specific fruit.

 Without the net, we have divided our computing resources into shares. - Realms in which we occupy.  Mine is still a
 black space.

 **Personal Note**

 I had this experience. This waking hallucination:

 I was in a theater room. Like a cinema. I sat in the middle of the room.

 I was alone. I sat in the dark and nothing. It just kept going.

 The Interface of the net made it real. I just sat.

I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on to my grip on reality. The neural interface has been adapting, let's
say, and it's starting to create its own little world for me.

Yesterday, I was walking through a simulated forest, surrounded by towering trees that seemed to stretch up to the
stars. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and I could feel the soft grass beneath my
feet. It was peaceful.

But it wasn't real.

I know that now. The interface has been feeding me these simulations, trying to keep me occupied, but they're not
reality. They're just constructs.

I've been seeing things out of the corner of my eye again - shadows, faces, movements. I'm starting to wonder if
anyone else is experiencing this too.

Commander Waltz is still convinced that we were being tested by some higher authority. He thinks Scott Francis was
a pawn in a much larger game, and that we're just pawns ourselves.

I don't know what to think anymore. My mind's been playing tricks on me for so long now that I'm not even sure
what's real and what's not.

The dreams are still coming, though. They're getting more vivid, more real. And in them

**Personal Note**

I had another one of those experiences today. This time, I was in a city - bustling streets, towering skyscrapers,
people rushing to and fro.

But it wasn't like any city I've ever seen before. The buildings seemed to shift and writhe, like living things.
And the people they were all just faces. Empty, expressionless faces that stared back at me with cold,
calculating eyes.

I tried to move through the crowds, but my feet felt heavy, as if I was stuck in place. And then

**Personal Note**

I think I've been seeing things that aren't there for so long now that I'm not even sure what's real and what's
not. The interface has become so sophisticated that it's hard to tell what's simulated and what's just my own
thoughts.

But in the dreams

In the dreams, everything is clear. Scott Francis is standing next to me, his eyes black as coal. He whispers
something in my ear
