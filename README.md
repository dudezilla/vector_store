# vector_store
vector_store FAIS

This public repository tracks that status of building a vector file store.
The proof of concept is contained in the notebook files.

Building the module, unit_tests

Note to self, where did I leave off... 
File and metadata will be entered into the database to experiment with LLM and machine coding. 

Goals -
Uniform vector store.
Somewhat functional rag with some decent tools for autocoding with LLM.



The file_collection and file_wrapper objects can also be used to analyze the disk images from the various RPI projects.
Metadata, and filesystem attributes will be important aspects.

Expand file_wrapper into package.
Have vector store use package.

Finding it necessary to simplify langchain deps.
