vector_store FAIS

This public repository tracks that status of building a vector file store.
The proof of concept is contained in the notebook files.

Building the module, unit_tests

Note to self, where did I leave off... 
File and metadata will be entered into the database to experiment with LLM and machine coding. 

Goals -
Uniform vector store.
Somewhat functional rag with some decent tools for autocoding with LLM.
